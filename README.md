# Data-Analysis-Projects

I have a dataset for analysis on restaurants in Los Angeles. With opening a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles in mind, I want to present our analytical finding 
to investors so as to attract them. They’re interested in the current market conditions — will we be able to maintain our success when the novelty of robot waiters 
wears off?

To run this analysis, I imported pandas, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib, usaddress, and regex libraries.

The dataset was provided by Practicum by Yandex, an online bootcamp. I do not have the permission to share this dataset used in this analysis.
