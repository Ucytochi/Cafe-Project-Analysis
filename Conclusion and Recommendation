Recommendations
1. Going with cafe, I recommend we make a chain establishment as there is a higher proportion of chains than non-chains under cafe.
2. Since there a little or no difference in the number of seats between chain and non-chain establishments for cafe and there is a higher frequency of number of seats in cafes between 0 and 50, I recommend we set 50 seats for our cafe.
3. I also recommend having our cafe on Sunset, World, or Wilshire Streets as they ranked the three highest populated streets for cafe.
